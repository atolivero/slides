# Slides

Repo to house the slides I've made over the years for various presentations

### Building Presentations

I'm currently using [Marp CLI](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli) to build my presentations.  While an argument could be made for [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/), I can't justify keeping track of the syntax when I use so much markdown in my day to day work.  Marp provides a convenient way to produce slides using a flavor of markdown, as well as a nice CLI to spin up a server to preview the compiled HTML.

Installation is easy (with a dependency of `npm`).  I've opted for a global install so it can be used anywhere:

```npm install -g @marp-team/marp-cli```
