## Leadership Manifesto
 - Challange people to solve their own problems
 - Learn exciting things every day
 - Don't be afraid to experiment

---

## Team Leader Manifesto

We believe:
 - great teams are grown, not hired,
 - leader's goal is to grow skills of team to self-organization
 - happier teams make happier customers and employers

This is done through:
 - challenging ourselves and our team to be better
 - a just-in-time adaptive leadership style
 - participating in human interaction

---

## Matching Leadership Sytles
1. Challenging People / Coach - encourage teaching and learning
2. Command-and-Control - putting out fires
3. Facilitating - lock team in a room and get out of the way

--- 

## Survival Mode
Most teams are here because they haven't learned enough, and for some, this is comfortable.

Getting Out:
 - create slack time (learning time productivitiy can be up to 10 times slower)
 - find current risks (imagine our project has failed 6 months from now; why did that happen?)
 - pick a point in time and put out fires until then (after that it's learning time)

---

## Learning Mode

This is when you have the slack time and using deliberate practice.

Learning Ravines:
 - adjustment periods 
 - jump into them -> don't be satisfied with the status quo

Commitment Language
 1. Say we'll do it
 2. Mean what we say
 3. Do it (or raise a red flag)


---

## Self-Organizing Mode

Team is working independently of the leader when making decisions and is moving forward in a productive manner.

## Other Notes

 - Feedback
 - Channel conflict into learning
 - Document your air, food, and water
 - Appraisals and Agile don't play nice
 - Your product is your team
 - Evolving from manager to leader
